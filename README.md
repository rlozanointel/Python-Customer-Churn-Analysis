Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of simulated customer churn data using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.

# Customer Churn Analysis
This script simulates customer churn data and performs exploratory analysis to understand churn patterns. It generates a synthetic dataset of customer attributes and churn status. The script then uses visualizations to explore the relationship between churn and factors like age, balance, and gender. These visualizations provide insights into customer churn behavior, aiding in identifying potential risk factors and informing strategies to reduce churn. Ultimately, the script generates a comprehensive overview of customer churn within the simulated dataset.
